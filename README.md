# Graphics 2D Tester

Overview
--------
A visual tester for implementations of Java2D's `Graphics2D` class.  The goal is
to perform a sanity check on the output from a particular subclass of `Graphics2D`. 
This includes, but is not limited to, the following libraries:

- [JFreeSVG](https://github.com/jfree/jfreesvg)
- [JFreePDF](https://github.com/jfree/jfreepdf)
- [FXGraphics2D](https://github.com/jfree/fxgraphics2d)
- [SkijaGraphics2D](https://github.com/jfree/skijagraphics2d)

Target Output
-------------
The expected output can be generated by running the test program against the
`Graphics2D` instance used by Java2D itself when drawing to a `BufferedImage`.  Here 
is an example (generated with Java 15 on MacOS):
